# Rise of Esports

Esports is a fascinating phenomenon within the billion-dollar gaming industry. Officially, esports stands for electronic sports. Although the terms "gaming" and "esports" are often used interchangeably, there are fundamental differences between the two. Gaming refers to playing video games, not necessarily in a competitive manner, and is a form of recreation. Whereas, esports are online games that are played competitively in the form of leagues or tournaments. Esports also include digital or virtual manifestations of traditional sports.
 
The ecosystem of esports is similar to that of traditional sports, with spectators, teams and players, sponsors, media distributors, advertisers, and organizers. Like traditional sports, esports also requires commitment, hard work, and training to excel and succeed in it. The popularity of esports has been rapidly increasing over the past few years, developing its own audience and fanbase, similar to traditional sports such as cricket and football. However, they differ in the way they reach their audience. While traditional sports exist on television, esports mainly reach its audience through streaming platforms such as YouTube and Twitch.
 
Over the past few years, the growth of the esports industry has been remarkable. It has already become the largest revenue-generating form of media, leaving movies and music behind. The esports industry is expected to grow fourfold to INR 11 billion by FY2025. Players participating in these tournaments are no less than stars, each having a great following and fanbase, mostly comprising of the youth. As esports grows popular among the youth and the affluent, advertisers and agencies are expected to increasingly use esports tournament viewership to gain reach and engagement with this young audience, eventually bringing more revenue to tournaments.
 
The viewership and the number of players participating in these various esports are increasing rapidly every year, thus attracting more sponsors and advertisers. There are various reasons which justify this rapid growth. Esports is more versatile, adaptable, and accessible than most regular sports. From the largest metropolis to the smallest village, esports provides a level playing field to everyone. Anyone with a smartphone and a proper network can play and stream. The increasing digitization and deeper internet penetration in India in the past few years have played a significant role in this. The esports industry is thus creating a more accessible profession for many.
 
The pandemic has also acted as a catalyst for the growing esports industry. Amid the lockdown, millions diverted their attention to gaming recreationally, thus exploring various esports tournaments and some even turning professional. It is estimated that esports will generate a total economic impact of over INR100 billion over the next four years through investments, direct industry revenues, in-app purchases, and other revenues. Esports is also responsible for creating many new jobs and increasing employability, with new employment opportunities in game development, programming, 3D art, design, testing, etc. Many startups in the field of esports and gaming are also emerging, catering to the rapidly increasing demand and needs of the industry.
 
The world is now recognizing the potential of esports, and it is getting recognition everywhere, including as a part of the Asian Games. The Indian government also needs to understand the potential and benefits of the esports industry. For the sector to achieve its potential, the Indian government can take various steps such as providing regulatory support by recognizing esports, creating a nodal esports body, providing SEZ benefits, giving development grants, and providing incentives for grassroots inclusion. By doing so, the Indian government can play a vital role in promoting the esports industry, thus paving the way for a better future for esports enthusiasts and professionalsÂ alike.
